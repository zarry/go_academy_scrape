## Go Academy Scrape

Simple CLI app to scrape a CodeAcademy.com user profile and return the day streak and daily activity.

## Why?

I wanted to learn golang and this happened to be a good playground while also helping keep track of a completition I started between myself 
and couple of my younger siblings. The goal was to see who could maintain the longest day streak on code academy.  This would allow
me to check that without having to manually visit each users profile.  

## Use

* go install
* go\_academy\_scrape -users="User1,User2,UserX"
